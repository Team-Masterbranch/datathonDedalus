## Queries
- 

## Data manager
- for some reason it loads data two times. Investigate.

## Query
- validation for a schema desactivated because of refactoring. Maybe in future we should 
  write methods for this.

## Refactoring
- vars starting with single underscore (_) should be class vars. If used outside of it's class, refactor to getters.
